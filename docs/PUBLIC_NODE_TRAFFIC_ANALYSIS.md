# Public Node Traffic Analysis: Shape Network vs Ethereum
**Analysis Date:** August 31, 2025  
**Current Setup:** Standard_D2s_v3 (2 vCPU, 8GB RAM) - Single Node

## 🌐 **Typical Public Node Traffic Patterns**

### **Ethereum Mainnet Public Node Traffic:**
- **RPC Requests**: 10,000-100,000+ requests/day for popular nodes
- **Peak Traffic**: 50-500 RPC calls/minute during high activity
- **WebSocket Connections**: 100-1000+ concurrent connections
- **Bandwidth**: 10-100 MB/s during sync, 1-10 MB/s steady state
- **Storage Growth**: ~500GB/year for full nodes

### **Shape Network Public Node Traffic (Expected):**
- **RPC Requests**: 1,000-50,000+ requests/day (growing L2)
- **Peak Traffic**: 10-200 RPC calls/minute
- **WebSocket Connections**: 50-500+ concurrent connections
- **Bandwidth**: Lower than Ethereum (L2 efficiency)
- **Storage Growth**: ~100-200GB/year (L2 optimization)

## 📊 **Current Resource Allocation vs Traffic Demands**

### **CPU Analysis:**

#### Current Allocation:
```
op-geth:    400m request / 800m limit
op-node:    200m request / 400m limit
Total:      600m request / 1200m limit
Available:  1300m remaining (68% free)
```

#### Traffic Impact on CPU:
| Traffic Level | CPU Usage Estimate | Status vs Current |
|---------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **Low** (1K RPC/day) | 200-400m | ✅ **Well within limits** |
| **Medium** (10K RPC/day) | 500-800m | ✅ **Comfortable** |
| **High** (50K RPC/day) | 800-1200m | ⚠️ **Near current limits** |
| **Very High** (100K+ RPC/day) | 1200-1800m | ❌ **Would need scaling** |

### **Memory Analysis:**

#### Current Allocation:
```
op-geth:    2Gi request / 3Gi limit
op-node:    1Gi request / 1.5Gi limit
Total:      3Gi request / 4.5Gi limit
Available:  3.7Gi remaining (45% free)
```

#### Traffic Impact on Memory:
| Traffic Level | Memory Usage Estimate | Status vs Current |
|---------------|----------------------|--------------------|
| **Low** (1K RPC/day) | 1-2Gi | ✅ **Excellent headroom** |
| **Medium** (10K RPC/day) | 2-3Gi | ✅ **Good headroom** |
| **High** (50K RPC/day) | 3-4Gi | ⚠️ **Approaching limits** |
| **Very High** (100K+ RPC/day) | 4-6Gi | ❌ **Would need more RAM** |

## 🚨 **Bottleneck Analysis**

### **Network I/O (Critical for Public Nodes):**
```
Current NGINX Ingress: 2m CPU, 42Mi RAM
Expected under load:   50-200m CPU, 100-500Mi RAM
```

### **Connection Limits:**
- **NGINX**: Default ~1000 concurrent connections
- **Kubernetes Service**: Default connection pooling
- **Node Network**: Azure VM network limits apply

### **Storage I/O:**
- **Current**: Azure managed-csi (premium SSD)
- **IOPS**: Limited by VM size (3,200 IOPS for Standard_D2s_v3)
- **Throughput**: 48 MB/s max for current VM size

### **Traffic Scenarios:**

#### **Small Public Node (Current Setup is Perfect):**
```
Users:           100-500 developers/applications
Daily RPC:       5,000-15,000 requests
WebSocket:       50-150 concurrent connections

## 🔧 **Scaling Recommendations**

### **For Current Traffic (Optimal):**
- ✅ **Keep current setup** - Perfect for small-medium public node
- ✅ **Monitor usage** - Set alerts at 80% CPU/memory
- ✅ **Enable horizontal scaling** - Add more nodes if needed

### **For High Traffic (Upgrade Options):**

#### **Option 1: Vertical Scaling (Single Node)**
```
VM Size:         Standard_D4s_v3 (4 vCPU, 16GB RAM)
Cost:            ~2x current cost
Capacity:        Handle 100K+ RPC requests/day
Resource:        4 vCPU, 16GB RAM
```

#### **Option 2: Horizontal Scaling (Multi-Node)**
```
Nodes:           2x Standard_D2s_v3 nodes
Load Balancer:   Azure Load Balancer (additional)
Capacity:        Handle 100K+ RPC requests/day
Cost:            ~2.2x current cost (LB overhead)
```

#### **Option 3: Hybrid Approach**
```
Primary:         Standard_D4s_v3 (main traffic)
Backup:          Standard_D2s_v3 (failover)
Setup:           Active-passive with auto-failover
Cost:            ~2.5x current cost
```

- ✅ Set up monitoring and alerting
- ✅ Optimize based on actual usage patterns

#### **Phase 2: Scale Based on Demand (6+ months)**
- 📊 **If CPU > 70%**: Vertical scale to Standard_D4s_v3

- 📊 **If Network > 70%**: Add load balancer + multiple nodes

#### **Phase 3: Production Scaling (12+ months)**
- 🚀 **Multi-region deployment**
- 🚀 **CDN integration**
- 🚀 **Auto-scaling groups**
- 🚀 **Dedicated database for indexing**

## 📋 **Monitoring Checklist**
